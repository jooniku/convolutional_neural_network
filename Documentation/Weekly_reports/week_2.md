# Week 2

This week was spent trying to find correct hyperparameters for the network. It is very time consuming, since each run takes multiple hours.
I have not been able to get more than ~93% accuracy. Next week I'll have to check wheter some data-augmentation or the likes could improve the accuracy, or perhaps there is a small mistake in the implementation. Total hours working ~ 10h.
