I found a course for building convnets by Standford and decided it would be the best use of my time to go through it, since the resources I had found were quite poor. This took a long time (roughly 20-25 hours) and due to that I was not able to progress much.

After reading the course material, I have a quite complete understanding of what to do and how to implement it. This is what I set out to do this week and in that regard I was successful. I did write the ReLU function and tests for it. I created the project (and network) structure (about 3 hours).

The network itself is the masterclass and layers are subclasses. I figured this is the best method, since I will probably continue to use this project after the course and modifications/optimatizations are expected.

Next week, I will start writing the different layers. I'll start with the input layer and will decide whether the images from the dataset need some pre-processing.
