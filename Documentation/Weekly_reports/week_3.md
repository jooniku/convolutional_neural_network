## Week 3
This week I changed the way the data is imported into the network (library change), this allowed me to normalize the data. After this I was able to achieve 94% accuracy. Total time spent ~7h. Next week I'll continue the hyperparameter lookup and try to get the accuracy into 97-98%. The model should be able to achieve it, but this week I did not have time to find better hyperparameters.
