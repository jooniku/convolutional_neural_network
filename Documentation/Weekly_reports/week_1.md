I was able to create the requirement specification document and start visualizing the network and its processes (e.g. how average pooling algorithm could be implemented). 

However, I am somewhat unsure as to how the neural network itself should be built. I prepose a class object (CNN) which would have multiple subclasses such as 3 instances of convolutional layer -classes etc. Is this a reasonable approach?

I am quite new to CNNs at a lower level, so I think using libraries for things like image preprocessing, mathematics and such would be fine as long as the network and its function themselves are completely constructed "by hand". Is this correct?

Next week I plan to dig deeper in to the last question and work with the different mathematical aspects of the network (such as ReLU implementation). I will write a precise, lower level structure plan of the network and each of its layers in such way that I can then write pseudocode for the different algorithms used.
