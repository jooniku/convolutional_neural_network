This week was mainly spent studying how convolutional neural networks work and how they are implemented. Read roughly 10-15 articles. About 5-7 hours spent reading.

Was able to learn a lot about how CNNs work and how they are done at a higher level. Mainly what are the different layers/processes and why they are done. 

Research is somewhat difficult since most scientific papers are a high-level representation of the network and almost all articles use external libraries to "build" the network. Because of this I really have to spend time fully understanding how and why different things are done the way they are and I can not simply follow pseudo code. 

I was able to create the requirement specification document and start visualizing the network and its processes (e.g. how average pooling algorithm could be implemented). 

However, I am somewhat unsure as to how the neural network itself should be built. I prepose a class object (CNN) which would have multiple subclasses such as 3 instances of convolutional layer -classes etc. Is this a reasonable approach?
