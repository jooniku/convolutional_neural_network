Got the network learning properly. Tested with 1 input image and 0-loss was reached. Training with small (~100) datasets converges the loss decently. Restructured some code. Time spent was ~20 hours.

Next week I'll have to complete the project. Mainly writing some documentation, tests and the application that uses the network. Also I'll have to train the network itself.
