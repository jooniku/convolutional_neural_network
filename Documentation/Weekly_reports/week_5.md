## Week 5

This week was spent mainly coding. I solved the last weeks backpropagation problem and got a few more, however, the network works! The learning is extremely slow due to inefficent convolution algorithm. Next week I'll try to implement matrix convolution if I have time. I got it to learn with roughly 80% accuracy with decent learning time. Convolution and pooling algorithms are tested with hand-computed examples. There are rudimentary testing and implementation documents. The total time for this week was roughly 25 hours.

Next week I hope the learning process gets faster and more accurate with the addition of matrix calculations. I'll also write more documentation and start building the app that controls the network. Perhaps, if I have time, I will also add the MNIST fashion dataset to the application, so it works with both.
