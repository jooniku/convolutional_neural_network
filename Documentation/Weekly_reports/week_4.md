This week I had a lot of work from other courses and was not able to proceed with the project at the desired pace. Currently, the best accuracy is 96%, and I will leave it at that. 
After next week the project should be completed. I just need to get the tests working and perhaps change the UI a bit. Time used this week ~2h.
