# Requirement Specification

## Problem specification
The idea is to create a tool that can take an image of hand-written numbers which are then recognized and classified appropriately.

## Solution specification
The solution is implemented with a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset of hand-written digits.

The neural network follows a simple architecture and for classification, a softmax regression model is used to return probabilities for each digit 0-9.
